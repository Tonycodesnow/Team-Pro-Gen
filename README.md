## Description

This is my Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each worker. <br />

## Installation
To install all the dependencies, use the command below:
```
npm i
```
<br />

## Usage

As a manager of a team, you would enjoy using this application to generate a webpage that displays your team's basic information so that you can quickly access their emails and GitHub profiles <br />

To use this application, clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone git@github.com:Tonycodesnow/Team-Pro-Gen.git
```

Then, ensure you install the dependencies with command:
```
npm i
```
When you're ready to run the application, from the root folder, type the below into your command line:
```
node index
```

Once the application runs, it will generate an index.html file in the "dist" folder. If you already have an index.html file in that folder, it will first prompt you to overwrite it or not.
